**Cloud Cup** is a modern, high-performance reverse proxy built for Linux in Zig, designed to handle today's web traffic demands with **speed**, **scalability**, and **resilience**.  

At its core, Cloud Cup implements a **master-worker architecture** that ensures **uninterrupted service**, **dynamic traffic management**, and **robust request handling**. Whether you’re a developer building microservices or an operations engineer managing web infrastructure, Cloud Cup offers the tools to keep your applications running smoothly and efficiently.

## Master-Worker Architecture  

Cloud Cup’s architecture revolves around its **master** and **worker processes**, each with distinct responsibilities:  

### Master Process  

- **Validates and applies configurations** at startup, ensuring they are correct before spawning workers.  
- **Hot reloads configurations** via the CLI (`cupctl`), where the CLI process validates the new configuration and distributes it to workers dynamically.  
- Spawns **multiple worker processes** and monitors them to ensure high availability. If a worker process exits unexpectedly, the master immediately spawns a replacement.  
- Manages the CLI command listener, enabling seamless interaction for updates and diagnostics.  

### Worker Process  

- All workers **listen on the same port and address**, leveraging the kernel to distribute incoming requests efficiently among them.  
- Each worker operates with its own **epoll instance** for high-performance request handling.  
- Utilizes an independent **thread pool** to handle requests concurrently, ensuring scalability and responsiveness.  
- Dynamically receives and applies configuration updates from the master process, maintaining consistency across all workers.  

This architecture ensures **Cloud Cup remains operational** even under heavy load or in the event of individual worker failures, delivering unparalleled reliability and performance.

## Why Choose Cloud Cup?  

Cloud Cup addresses modern challenges in web traffic management with cutting-edge features:  

- **Zero Downtime**: The master-worker model ensures high availability, with automatic worker respawning and dynamic configuration updates.  
- **Kernel-Level Efficiency**: Workers listening on the same port let the Linux kernel manage request distribution, optimizing resource utilization.  
- **Performance at Scale**: Each worker uses its own `epoll` and thread pool, maximizing throughput and responsiveness.  
- **Dynamic Management**: Use the CLI to validate, reload, and apply configurations without interrupting traffic.  
- **High Customizability**: Define granular routes and backends using a simple JSON file.
