# Releases  

Cloud Cup follows the **Semantic Versioning** scheme (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) to ensure clarity in updates and backward compatibility. The project also maintains dedicated branches for each minor version, while the `main` branch reflects the upcoming features and major changes in development.  

---

## Versioning Strategy  

- **MAJOR**: Introduces incompatible API changes.  
- **MINOR**: Adds functionality in a backward-compatible manner.  
- **PATCH**: Fixes bugs or makes backward-compatible improvements.  

> **Tip**: For stable environments, we recommend sticking to a specific minor release branch, such as `release-0.1`.  

---

## Release Process  

- **Main Branch**: Represents the latest work in progress, which will eventually lead to the next major or minor release.  
- **Release Branches**: Each minor version (e.g., `release-0.1`) is maintained separately for stability and patch updates.  

### Lifecycle Example  

1. Development of features begins on the `main` branch.  
2. Upon stabilization, a new minor version is branched off (e.g., `release-0.1`).  
3. Critical bug fixes or patches for an existing version are applied directly to its release branch (e.g., `release-0.1.1`).
