# Cloud Cup v0.1.0-alpha.1 Pre-release  

**Release Date**: 2024-11-24  

We are thrilled to announce the first pre-release of Cloud Cup! 🎉  
This version lays the foundation for a powerful, high-performance reverse proxy with a focus on configurability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

## 🚀 v0.1.0-alpha.1 - First Release  

### 🎉 Key Features  

#### Core Functionality  
- **Configurable JSON-based setup** for:  
  - Server address and port.  
  - SSL settings.  
  - Flexible route definitions.  
- **Dynamic hot-reload support** via the `cupctl` CLI.  
- **Advanced routing system**:  
  - Support for default (`*`) and wildcard (`/example/*`) routes.  
  - Configurable backends with failover (`max_failure` setting).  

#### Load Balancing  
- Default **round-robin strategy** for efficient traffic distribution.  
- Independent **epoll and thread pools per worker**, enabling high-concurrency request handling.  

#### SSL  
- **Optional SSL support** with certificates and private keys for secure HTTPS connections.  

#### Fault Tolerance  
- **Failure management**:  
  - Backends automatically recover after successful requests.  
  - Prevents infinite retries when all backends are down.  

#### Scalability  
- **Multiple worker processes** listening on the same address and port.  
  - The kernel seamlessly distributes incoming requests among workers.

### 🔧 Improvements & Optimizations  

- Highly optimized for handling **concurrent requests**.  
- Designed to be **lightweight and efficient**, making it a strong alternative to traditional load balancers.
