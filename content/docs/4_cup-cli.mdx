## üöÄ Usage

Here are the commands available with Cup CLI:

#### Check Application Status

Shows whether the Cloud-Cup application is running or not:
```bash
cup show status
```
#### View Current Configuration

Displays the current configuration file the application is using:
```bash
cup show config
```
#### Check Backend Health

##### Check All Backends

Verifies the health of all configured backend servers:
```bash
cup check
```
##### Check a Specific Backend

Checks the health of a backend server by specifying its address:
```bash
cup check -b <backend-address>
```
Replace `<backend-address>` with the IP or hostname of the backend (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8081`).

##### Check Route Functionality 

Checks if a specific route is functioning as expected:
```bash
cup check -r <route-name>
```
Replace `<route-name>` with the name of the route (e.g., `*` or `/example/*`).

#### Apply a New Configuration 

Applies a new configuration file and performs a hot reload of the application:
```bash
cup apply -f <file-path>
```
Replace `<file-path>` with the path to the new configuration file (e.g., `configs/new-config.json`).

### üõ°Ô∏è Notes
  - Dynamic Hot Reload: All changes made using cup apply are applied without restarting the server.
  - Health Checks: Regularly use cup check to ensure backend servers and routes are healthy.
